# PaintPot
This is a simple drawing application created using MIT App Inventor. It allows users to draw on a canvas using their finger, with options to select red, blue, or green paint colors and a button to clear the drawing. It supports drawing dots when the canvas is touched and lines when the canvas is dragged.
